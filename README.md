About:

This project will be a 3d game engine written in C++ that exposes the Vulkan API and uses GLFW for window and surface creation, as well as input handling. 

Since I'm developing this on MacOS, I have to use MoltenVK to translate the vulkan API into Apple's proprietary API, Metal. I'm not sure how complicated this will prove to be down the line, but I'm up for the challenge and am currently fixing a few bugs during setup.
